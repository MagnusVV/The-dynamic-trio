Summary:
A cute little web application that fetches all species- and vehicle-objects from SWAPI. Using these, you can create character cards for either jedi or sith characters.

Possible future developments:

- Adding either a possibility to save the cards via local storage, or via download.
- Adding i picture of the character on the card(s).
