## About
This project is the final task in the React.js course. I found React to be pretty hard. I get it better now, but it still feels a bit hard to grasp. Fun to make this app, though, and super fun to tap SWAPI for information!

Summary:
A cute little web application that fetches all species- and vehicle-objects from SWAPI. Using these, you can create character cards for either jedi or sith characters.

Possible future developments:

- Adding either a possibility to save the cards via local storage, or via download.
- Adding i picture of the character on the card(s).
